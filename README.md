## **Key Features**

### **AQI Prediction**
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e3e1e2d-6ec4-437e-9b27-9e3a1ba49ec1)
AeroSense allows users to predict air quality precisely across any city or station in India. The application leverages sophisticated **time-series models** to forecast pollutant concentrations, which are then processed through deep learning networks to compute AQI based on **CPCB AQI calculation standards**. Users can:

- Select a city or monitoring station.
- Specify a future date and time for prediction.
- Receive immediate air quality predictions based on forecasted pollutant levels.

### **Real-time AQI Monitoring**
Access live AQI data for **12 major metro cities** in India, along with a nationwide overview. The intuitive dashboard enables users to:

- Track current AQI levels in real-time.
- Compare air quality across different cities.
- Obtain an at-a-glance summary of the nationâ€™s overall air quality.

### **AQI Forecasting**
Analyze AQI trends with predictions covering **four days prior** and **four days ahead** of any selected date. This feature provides users with valuable insight into historical and forecasted air quality, helping to anticipate and prepare for environmental changes by:

- Reviewing historical air quality data.
- Exploring future AQI trends.
- Making informed decisions based on forecasted air quality conditions.

### **Weather Integration**
Weather conditions are seamlessly integrated into the dashboard, providing users with up-to-date information on:

- Current **temperature, humidity, precipitation, and wind speed**.
- **5-day weather forecast**, helping users plan ahead based on both weather and air quality predictions.

### **Lightweight LSTM Neural Network for Air Quality Prediction**
AeroSense utilizes **Lightweight Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Networks** for time-series forecasting of air quality. This model is optimized to:

- Predict future AQI values with minimal computational resources by efficiently analyzing historical pollutant data.

- Process data from various air quality stations, including PM2.5, NO2, CO, SO2, O3, and other key pollutants.
 
- Leverage temporal features like date, time, and seasonality, while maintaining fast and accurate predictions on low-power devices.

## **Technology Stack**

- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Tailwind CSS), JavaScript (Next.JS)
- **Backend:** Python & Django
- **Machine Learning & Deep Learning:** TensorFlow, Keras, LSTM Neural Networks
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- **API Integration:** Real-time AQI data APIs and weather forecast APIs

## **How AeroSense Works**

1. **Data Collection:** Real-time AQI and weather data are continuously fetched from monitoring stations and external APIs.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** The raw data is processed, including **feature scaling** and **sequence creation**, to prepare it for prediction.
3. **Prediction Engine:** Using **LSTM models**, future pollutant concentrations are forecasted, and AQI values are computed.
4. **Interactive User Interface:** Users can explore predictions through an intuitive interface, selecting cities, and dates.
5. **Insights:** Input environmental factors such as temperature and vehicular traffic, and visualize their real-time effect on future AQI.

## **Future Enhancements**

- Development of a **mobile application** for on-the-go AQI monitoring and forecasting.
- Enhanced **AI-driven suggestions** with more granular insights into health risks and mitigation strategies.
- Expansion of AQI monitoring to cover additional cities and rural regions across India.
- Global AQI tracking for international comparison and insights into air quality trends worldwide.
